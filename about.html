                    About GitBauble
                </h1>
                <h3>A story of how a simple project to make the lives of developers more fun turned into an in-demand product.</h3>
                <p>During one of his summers as an intern out in San Francisco, Ryan was sitting at his work
                    desk next to his team, headphones in just grinding away at work. To him, this was a common experience.
                    Of course his teammates talked and interacted with one another, but there were long periods during the day where
                    everybody would be furiously typing away. Ryan noticed that when this was happening, the amount of commits/pushes/merges
                    that were happening was astronomical. Everybody was doing so much work, yet the only way you would know is by the dull ring
                    of an email notification in your inbox.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During these days Ryan had a simple thought, "How could I make these work grinds more enjoyable?" 
                    Overtime, the idea sprung in his head, why not make a little toy that cheers or claps for you when close a Pull Request?
                    From this idea, he began trying, and ultimately failing to implement a piece of hardware that could do what he wanted.
                </p>
                <p>However, he would not give up - he was determined to make this project a reality. After many discussions with friends and family
                    he pivoted the overall design of his toy to take on the 'blob' shape that it currently has. 
                </p>
                <p>Eventually taking up the project again, and recruiting some friends to help with the hardware, he was able to create a 
                    functional product. Furthering the functionality of GitBauble, Ryan realized that if he was making a developer inspired toy, then he would 
                    need to give developers end-points to be able to do with what they please. On top of this, GitBauble also began to
                    become a little bit more practical for developers. Instead of just dancing whenever you want, your GitBauble can also
                    be hooked up with your current local git repo and will change colors depending on its current status. Suddenly, GitBauble
                    has transformed from a simple toy to make people smile, to a toy that - while still playful and fun - actually had some usefulness.
                </p>

                    GitBauble is still in the process of coming to market, but if you're interested in the overall progess of GitBauble, please feel
